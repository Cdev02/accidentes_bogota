# Accidentality rates in Bogotá - Colombia
The code in this repository was used for a research project that seeks to create a model that describes the accidentality rate in the city of Bogotá - Colombia based on variables such as total area of vehicular flow per district, total area of pedestrian flow by district, bike paths, population density, among others.

The first step we took in this research project was to create a casualties matrix that shows how many victims there was per traffic participants combination (for example, car - PTW or pedestrian - public_transport). We achieved two results: One based on the whole city and other per borough. 

The datasets used for the notebook *'casualties_matrix'* can be found here -> https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CJn9MFY2KcpDapZhwz5mtxj99wH8AfQZ
